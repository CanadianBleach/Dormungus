# Overview
I really enjoy creating systems in games. I think the process of impleting code is really fun. Among Us seemed like it was a game that would be fun to recreate and it also had a bunch of systems to implement. My main focus was creating a task system that was easy to add new tasks to. I also made it east to add all kinds of different tasks. I paid a lot of attention to inheritance when I was creating this game.
